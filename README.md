Client requested a program that would allow them to more effectivley track if employee salaries were within budget. The salary calculator allows the client to add all relevant information (name, ID, title, and salary) and dynamically remove when said employee information is irrelevant. Additionally, if the total salary information is higher than the pre-set budget, the program warns the client by highlighting the information in red.
